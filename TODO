add private driving /extra paths, choosing files, Flag

circular sub ways every day / 2 days / 3 days ...

composition of sub ways /including optimization/

total mileage must check /also with prev final way/, prev end point of way must
    match current start point

improve efficiency of buildListTr by randomly eliminateing choices /when there
    are more than 2 choices in a single step/

parsePaths
    isCity, isDistance, missingCiti, missingDistance, warnMoreThings

add the final adjustment method for optimal Tr
    randomly (incr/decr by 1) way steps

wrap the whole program /main/ into a random generator ?

develop a tree based algorithm

dates and times processing - add to data structure

develop time and date processing /generation, simulation/
    Saturdays and Sundays and holidays only private driving

alternatively use Data.Sequence instead of lists / DiffLists ???


--  change buildTrList with runState StateT with result added to State  ???
--  sortByDist  ???
